        <h1>Hi, I'm Serra!</h1>
        <p>I am a full-stack developer who loves solving puzzles and tinkering. Whether itâ€™s building a 3D printed keyboard or trying to understand how someone cut down loading times for a game, I am always seeing how software engineering fits into my everyday life. In marrying the two together, I am able to remain passionate not just about my hobbies, but my work as well.</p>
